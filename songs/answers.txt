Characterization of the listener’s audio aura:
Based on the listener’s top 100 songs from 2018, we can observe a certain musical profile – for example, dominant genre, tempo, energy level, or mood.
If most songs are fast, energetic pop or rock, the listener’s “audio aura” could be described as dynamic and cheerful.
If slower, more melancholic songs prevail, the aura might be calm and reflective.

Why this method of calculation might be unrepresentative:
The data only includes the top 100 songs, not the listener’s full listening history, so it may not reflect their complete taste.
The year 2018 is just a single snapshot – musical preferences may change over time.
It does not consider listening frequency, different playlists, or occasional genres.
The top 100 might be dominated by popular hits, not personal favorites.

Better ways to calculate the audio aura:
Analyze all listened tracks over a longer period, not just the top 100.
Take into account listening frequency and time spent on each track.
Calculate average song attributes (tempo, energy, mood) from the full listening history.
Group songs by genre or mood and determine the percentage share of each type of music.
Track changes in taste over time, e.g., creating “audio snapshots” by year.
